    <p class="inner_text">Here, you link your MHF account which you already created with your Discord account. The game can be played without doing this; however, we strongly recommend that you do so. Becacuse you can't take advantage of all of the functions which are the best part of Rain Server, if you don't link your account to discord one.</p>
